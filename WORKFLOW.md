## Project Workflow

- The pdf is rendered with data from excel sheet which is embedded on the html template.
- The template needs to have html element with class as `dynamic-value` where the excel data value will be placed.
- The number of `dynamic-value` class element in the tamplate file and number of columns in excel sheet must be equal.
- You can convert certificate pdf to picture and use that picture as background image for making template.
- You also need to fix the position of html element with `dynamic-value` class (`top`, `left`).
